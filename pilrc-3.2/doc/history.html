What's new in 3.2 (Friday, 9 July 2004)
-----------------
o Fixed bug introduced in 3.0 with frame values for popup triggers that
  caused repainting problems.
o Updated NAVIGATION resource documentation
o Modified header file generation to not output a new file when the header
  file that would be output is identical to one that already exists.
o Added NOGRAFFITISTATEINDICATOR keyword that is used to tell PilRC
  that a form intentionally has no GSI and that it should not warn
  about it being missing.
o Added "#undef FOO".
o Regardless of the native line termination, accepts text files with either
  native, DOS (CR-LF), Unix (LF), or Macintosh (CR) line termination.
o Changed parsing of WORDLIST, LONGWORDLIST, and BYTELIST to allow
  expressions.  If you need to specify a negative number, you can use
  parenthesis around the number to prevent the minus sign from being
  interpreted incorrectly.
o Fixed relative positioning based on the size of a Graffiti State Indicator

What's new in 3.1 (Wednesday, 31 December 2003)
-----------------
o Form objects defined with AUTO width were made too wide by PilRC 3.0; this
  bug is now fixed and the original widths restored
o FONTFAMILY emits a warning if e.g. a double density glyph is not precisely
  double the size of the corresponding single density glyph
o FONTFAMILY now requires a FONTID to be specified, just as FONT does
  (this is an incompatible change; previous FONTFAMILYs are now syntax errors)
o "#define FOO" defines FOO to 0 by default rather than being a syntax error

What's new in 3.0 (Monday, 22 December 2003)
-----------------
o Enhanced bitmap family support
  - 108dpi (1.5x) and 144dpi (2x) density support
  - Handspring PalmRC bitmap syntax support
  - Unified bitmap parser
o Transparency implemented for PBM/PGM/PPM/PNM files
o .pbitm files now generate type 1 bitmaps (suitable for use in families)
  rather than type 0 bitmaps
o Accepts #error, #line, and "linemarkers" as emitted by the GNU preprocessor
o Predefines the preprocessor symbols __rcp__ and __PILRC__
o Supports #defines for strings
o All text strings now support line continuation
o FONTFAMILY resource support
o NAVIGATION resource support (useful for the PalmOne Treo 600)
o Palm OS 5 "LE32" resource format support
o Added GENERATEHEADER and RESETAUTOID keywords
o MENU SEPARATOR now supports an ID field to allow you to match PalmRez 
  menu formats

  - icon bitmap sizes don't follow PalmSource specifications
  - forms with edit fields lack Graffiti State Indicator
o Many miscellaneous bug fixes
