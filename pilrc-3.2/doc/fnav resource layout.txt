initialObjectIDHint
ID of the object where focus is positioned when the form is initialized. If initialObjectIDHint is 0, the operating system places the initial focus on the first action button, if there is one, or on the first object in the tab order if there is not. 

jumpToObjectIDHint
ID of the object to which focus can "jump", if the device supports this feature. Devices can optionally have an action trigger the movement of the focus to a commonly used object.

bottomLeftObjectIDHint
For platforms that cycle vertically, this field specifies which object receives the focus when navigating up from an object in the top row of the form (an object whose aboveObjectID [see FrmNavOrderEntryType] is 0). A bottomLeftObjectIDHint value of zero means that focus does not cycle vertically in the form.

padding1
Structure padding bytes.

{
  p_int	objectID;
  p_int objectFlags;  /* Try 0 */
  p_int aboveObjectID;
  p_int belowObjectID;
}

aboveObjectID
ID of the object that is above the object being described. Should be 0 if the object being described is in the top row of the form. If the user navigates up from an object with 0 for its above object, some platforms will move the focus to the object specified by bottomLeftObjectIDHint in the forms FrmNavHeaderType structure.

belowObjectID
ID of the object that is below the object being described. Should be 0 if the object is in the bottom row of the form. If the user navigates down from an object with 0 for its below object, some platforms will move the focus to the first object in the tab order.

navFlags:

#define kFrmNavHeaderFlagsAppFocusStartState 0x00000002
If this flag is set, the form will initially be in application focus mode.

#define kFrmNavHeaderFlagsAppFocusStartStateValue 0x00000002
After masking the flag bits with kFrmNavHeaderFlagsStartStateMask, the result can be compared with this value to determine if the form will initially be in application focus mode.

#define kFrmNavHeaderFlagsAutoGenerated 0x80000000

#define kFrmNavHeaderFlagsDefaultStartStateValue 0x00000000
After masking the flag bits with kFrmNavHeaderFlagsStartStateMask, the result can be compared with this value to determine if the form's initial focus mode will be chosen by the system.

#define kFrmNavHeaderFlagsInvalidStartStateValue 0x00000003
After masking the flag bits with kFrmNavHeaderFlagsStartStateMask, the result can be compared with this value to determine if the focus mode flags are improperly set.

#define kFrmNavHeaderFlagsObjectFocusStartState 0x00000001
If this flag is set, the form will initially be in object focus mode.

#define kFrmNavHeaderFlagsObjectFocusStartStateValue 0x00000001
After masking the flag bits with kFrmNavHeaderFlagsStartStateMask, the result can be compared with this value to determine if the form will initially be in object focus mode.

#define kFrmNavHeaderFlagsStartStateMask 0x00000003
A mask that allows you to isolate the "start state" bits and treat the result as a value. The result can be compared with any of the kFrmNavHeaderFlags...StartStateValue constants to determine the starting state.

Comments
If neither kFrmNavHeaderFlagsObjectFocusStartState nor kFrmNavHeaderFlagsAppFocusStartState is set, then the system decides whether to initially put the form in object focus mode or application focus mode. It is an error if both flags are set.


ObjectFlags:

#define kFrmNavObjectFlagsForceInteractionMode 0x0002
Used with multi-line text fields, if this flag is set the field is put in interaction mode when it receives the focus. Otherwise, the field is drawn in the focused, non-interaction mode state when it receives the focus.

#define kFrmNavObjectFlagsIsBigButton 0x8000
The object is a "big button." Big buttons are a type of UI object created by palmOne. Basically, they are thumbable buttons with a bitmap and some text. They are implemented as gadgets.

#define kFrmNavObjectFlagsSkip 0x0001
If this flag is set, the object is skipped when focus moves from object to object. The object is included in the order only when it explicitly gets focus (which primarily occurs when a field, table with a field, popup trigger, or selector trigger gets focus by being tapped with the pen).


Grafitti Shift Indicator and Bitmap cannot be navigated to. Label and Scrollbar are always skipped. If you navigate to slider, the arrows on the five way control the slider and do not tab.
