NS Basic/Palm 4.4 creates programs for all Palm OS devices running Palm OS 3.1 or later, including Palm OS 5.x. It runs on Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP. Using Virtual PC, it will run on Mac OS. It will run on Linux using Win4Lin and VMWare.<p>Version 4.x is upwardly compatible with Version 3.x and 2.x. Programs written in those versions should be able to run in the new version without changes. The new Runtime will also work with your older compiled projects.<p>NS Basic/Palm is a commercial software product, licensed subject to the License Agreement that must be clicked on during installation. The Agreement also appears in the NS Basic/Palm Handbook.<p>This document contains what you need to know to install and run NS Basic/Palm.<p>Please visit our web site for the latest version of this document. You'll see the latest installation notes and updated news.<H4>NS Basic/Palm Features</H4><UL>	<LI>Fully optimized for Palm OS 5 devices	<LI>Easy to use, standard and structured BASIC 	<LI>Over a dozen screen objects 	<LI>Create buttons, fields, popups and more 	<LI>Serial, IR and internet communications 	<LI>Math and trigonometric function support 	<LI>Produces standard Palm apps 	<LI>Royalty free 	<LI>Built in database support 	<LI>Signature Capture 	<LI>Barcode Reader support	<LI>Supports Palm, Handspring, Symbol, Kyocera, Sony, Samsung, HandEra and others	<LI>Test on the Palm OS Emulator or Simulator	<LI>Lots of sample code 	<LI>150 page Handbook</UL>The easiest way to program Palm OS devices!<hr><h3><a name="demo">1. Book Edition</h3>If you are running the Book Edition, welcome! This is a full version of NS Basic/Palm, with some restrictions:<UL>	<LI>Apps you create will only run for 5 days.	<LI>Apps created do not need a runtime.	<LI>Shared Libraries are not included. The full edition has a number of shared libraries that add lots of additional features and support for special devices. For more information, see the <A HREF="http://www.nsbasic.com/palm/info/technotes/">Tech Notes</A>.</UL>There is no need to download the NS Basic Runtime since the Book Edition automatically builds it into your app.<hr><a name="install"><H3>2. How to do a new installation of NS Basic/Palm</H3> <p>You can install NS Basic/Palm directly from this document if you are installing from the release CD. If you already have an earlier version of NS Basic/Palm installed, uninstall it first. The link immediately below to Nsbasic4.exe will only work if you are running this from the installer CD.<OL>	<LI>Install <A HREF="NsbasicBookEdition.exe">NsbasicBookEdition.exe</A>. This will install all the necessary files onto your desktop, and put NS Basic/Palm on your Start menu. Click on the link and select the option "Run this program from its current location". <br>You may see the message "The publisher cannot be determined due to the problem below: Authenticode signature not found." It is safe to ignore this message.	<LI>Once the installation is complete, start NS Basic/Palm. If you have the full version, enter your serial number (from the back of your Handbook) into Register under the Help menu. Otherwise, the programs you create will time out after 5 days. 	<LI>From the Run menu, download the NS Basic Runtime and Mathlib to your device. There is no need to download the Runtime if you set the Build Option for Fat Apps. Mathlib is only required if you are using the additional math functions. 	<LI><A HREF="http://www.nsbasic.com/register.shtml">Register your copy</A> so we can keep you up to date. (If you bought directly from us, you are automatically registered).	<LI>To use Pocket Purchase, run its installer separately.<br>	If installing from the CD, <A HREF="PPurNSBasic.exe">run this installer</A>.<br>	If you are downloading, <A HREF="http://pocketpurchase.com/PPurNSBasic.exe">run this installer</A>.</OL><p>If you are not able to install directly from this document, click on the file named Nsbasic4.exe.<p>If you have problems with the installation, see <A HREF="http://www.nsbasic.com/palm/info/technotes/TN01.htm">Tech Note 01</A>. <H4>Getting Started</H4>From the Start... Programs... menu, select NS Basic/Palm OS, then NS Basic Palm IDE. It will bring up a dialog box. Select "Other Existing Projects" and pick one of the Samples. You will then be able to browse the project and compile the .prc file to run on your Palm device. You should also try the Tutorials: they are on the Start menu.<H4>Using NS Basic/Palm with Windows Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew, Greek, etc.</H4> NS Basic/Palm can work with double byte character sets. If there is a string table for your language, the settings will be automatic. Here is how to set up NS Basic/Palm:<UL>	<LI>Start NS Basic/Palm.	<LI>Go into Tools...Options...Palm Screen	<LI>Set the checkbox "Draw Plain Text Objects"	<LI>Set the font to a monospaced local font, such as MS Gothic (Japanese)	<LI>Within the Code Window, the font can also be set.</UL>See also <A HREF="http://nsbasic.com/palm/Japanese/">http://nsbasic.com/palm/Japanese/</A><hr><a name="POSE"><H3>3. How to run your program on your desktop</H3>There are two ways to run your programs on the desktop. POSE lets you emulate a pre Palm OS 5.0 device, while the Simulator emulates a Palm OS 5.x device. You can download, start and stop programs on either one from within the NS Basic's Run menu. Use Tools...Options to select which one you want to use. Don't forget to download the Runtime if you are not building a Fat App.<p>Important: The Simulator, the ROM images and the associated files are licensed from PalmSource. When you install NS Basic, you agree to an End User License Agreement with PalmSource that has the terms of the license. A copy of the Agreement is in the \Program File\NSBasic folder.<p><b>POSE - Palm OS Emulator</b><p>NS Basic installs a copy of POSE with the ROM of a color Palm III running Palm OS 4.1. If you would like emulate a different device, you will also need to get the appropriate ROM image from the manufacturer of your device.<p>You may also be able to get a ROM image from your device. Using ROM Transfer.prc (in the Download folder), you can upload ROM images from most devices to the desktop. You can then use the transferred ROM file with POSE. <p>Each device has their own version of the ROM, sometimes with special features that are only on that device. The manufacturers sometimes, but not in all cases, have a special version of POSE that must be used.<p>The configuration of the Emulator is saved in the file \WINNT\Palm Emulator.ini. <p>If you want to get a copy of Palm's ROM or get the complete POSE documentation and files, go to<A HREF="http://www.palmos.com/dev/tools/emulator/">http://www.palmos.com/dev/tools/emulator/</A>. For more information on using POSE, see<UL>	<LI>	<A HREF="http://www.nsbasic.com/palm/info/technotes/TN20.htm">Tech Note 20</A>	<LI>	<A HREF="http://oasis.palm.com/dev/kb/papers/1311.cfm">Palmsource's POSE Tutorial</A></UL><b>Simulator</b><p>The Palm OS Simulator is Palm OS 5 running native on a Windows machine.  It comes complete with a Palm OS 5 ROM, so there is no need to download or upload a ROM image. The Simulator puts a Palm OS 5 device on your desktop to run your programs. You can control it from within NS Basic in exactly the same manner as POSE. <p>The first time you run it, it will ask you to accept a license agreement. After doing so, shut down the Simulator and restart it. You may get error messages when doing so: you may ignore them.<p>Some manufacturers have special versions of the Simulator to emulate specific devices: for example, Pa1mOne has a Tungsten T|3 version. You can download this (after executing appropriate license agreements) from the PalmOne website. You can use it with NS Basic by changing the pathname to the Simulator in Tool...Options. <p>You can download the full Simulator from <A HREF="http://www.palmos.com/dev/tools/simulator/">http://www.palmos.com/dev/tools/simulator/</A>. This also includes full documentation on using the Simulator.<hr><a name="bugs"><H3>5.
