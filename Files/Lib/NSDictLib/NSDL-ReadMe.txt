NS Basic for Palm OS Dictionary Library (NSDL)===================================DESC:----------Implements a key/value dictionary container object. Useful for storing named variables, preferences, limited user input etc.All stored entries are in the heap, so they can't be too big.SAMPLE USE:----------------------Include "NSDictLib", "NSDL"			' Include that in the startup code...' Create a new dictionary object; the library can produce and operate over multiple dictionaries' which is very convenientDim gDict as IntegergDict = NSDL.NewDict()t1 = Now()NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key1", "Value1")NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key2", "Value2")NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key3", "Value3")NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key4", "Value4")NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key5", "Value5")NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key6", "Value6")NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key7", "Value7")NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key8", "Value8")NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key9", "Value9")NSDL.AddKeyVal(gDict, "Key0", "Value0")t2 = Now()varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key1")varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key2")varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key3")varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key4")varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key5")varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key6")varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key7")varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key8")varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key9")varpref = NSDL.GetKeyVal(gDict, "Key0")t3 = Now()Alert("Times NSDL String", Str(TimeDiff(t1, t2)) + ", " + Str(TimeDiff(t2, t3)), 0, "OK")' Free the dictionary objectNSDL.FreeDict(gDict)(c) 2008 Bobby KolevBEIKS LLCwww.beiks.comA Pocket Full Of Knowledge
