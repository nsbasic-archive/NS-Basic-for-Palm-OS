<p>In this document, I will introduce how to display a table nicely.
	  <p>Tables are used quite often in applications for many kinds. In a word processor, for example, you may draw lines to create table for organizing data on the screen. That is, a table is a collection of cells, which is arranged in both  horizontal and vertical directions, but Palm doesn't have such a table object for developers. You can draw lines to create a table but the table doesn't let you select or scroll cells. The method I will explain here is to draw lines on the screen while letting users to get data from the table.
<BR>
<p>Look at the screen below. <A HREF="TN25.images/testsheet_code.zip">This application</a> (Creator ID: TEST), made only by NS Basic, is able to scroll the cells vertically and select data.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="TN25.images/1601.gif"><BR>
<BR>
It looks like it is using a grid object, but look at the IDE window below:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="TN25.images/1602.gif"><BR>
<BR>
The project have a bitmap but there are only three buttons on the screen.<br>
This bitmap is <br> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="TN25.images/1603.gif"><BR>
<BR>Texts are drawn directly on the bitmap using the DrawChars command.
<BR>
	  <p>The program works  as follows:<br>
It first defines an array that stores date, content and price. I prepared the following user-defined variable by using Type:<br>
<PRE>
    Type SheetData
        sWhen as String       'when
        sWhat as String       'what
        sHow as Integer       'how much
    End Type
    
    Global ShDat(30) as SheetData     'array for display
</PRE>

<p>The difference between VB and NS Basic is the place of braces "()".
<pre>
     In NS Basic:
          ShDat.sWhat(i)
     In Visual BASIC:
          ShDat(i).sWhat
</pre>

<p>Now, we put dummy data in the variable. The date field contains just a number "day" because I assume that "year" and "month" would be displayed somewhere else. The data here doesn't mean anything.<br>
<PRE>
Sub Project_Startup()
    
    Type SheetData
        sWhen as String       'when
        sWhat as String       'what
        sHow as Integer       'how much
    End Type
    
    Global ShDat(30) as SheetData     'array for display
    
    'make dummy data here
    Dim i as Integer
    
    For i=1 to 25
        ShDat.sWhen(i) = Trim(Str(Int(i/3)+1))
        ShDat.sWhat(i) = "Data" + str(Int(i/3))
        ShDat.sHow(i) = 100*Rand()*100
    Next
    
End Sub
</PRE>

<p>Actually, even though there are 30 elements in the array, there are 25 records. <BR>
<BR>
<p>Now, we display the data on the bitmap. The idea is like this:<br>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="TN25.images/1604.gif"><BR>
<BR>
<p>The important point is which record comes to the top of the table. If we find it, we can display 8 records from that record. So we need a variable to keep track of the record.<BR>
<PRE>
    Global iTop as Integer          'top record data

    'initialization
    iTop=1
</PRE>
<p>The initial value for the variable is 1.<br>
If you pay attention to the coordinates, writing character data is not difficult. The size of the table I prepared is:<br>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="TN25.images/1605.gif"><BR>
<BR>
Then, the vertical coordinate of <i>i</i>th record is:<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i * 14 + Py<br><br>

where Py is the vertical coordinate of the top field. The code is:<br>

<PRE>
    Dim iSt as Integer
    Dim iEd as Integer
    
    DrawBitmap 1004,0,16

    iSt=iTop
    iEd=iTop+7
    
    For j=iSt to iEd
        jy= (j-iSt) * 14 + 31

         .....

    Next
</PRE>
<p>You have to consider the following things:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>If iTop becomes greater than prepared elements of array.
<LI>How to represent the selected record. (highlighting)
</UL>

<p>You have probably understood the outline of the table creation. Please check the source code for details. You can download the project file <A HREF="TN25.images/testsheet_code.zip">here</a>. 
<p>As you know from the sample, the process is quite fast, so you don't need to use a character object such as Label, drawing characters by DrawChars are very practical. Although non-object program seems old-fashioned, in some case,
it may be better to use graphics window than using objects.
