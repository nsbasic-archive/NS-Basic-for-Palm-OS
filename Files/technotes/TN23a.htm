    <TD><font face="Arial">Once we know the internal structure of the "PDB" file (<A HREF="TN02a.htm">See Tech Note 02a</A>), we can 

    access it like any other file in regular Palm memory.&nbsp; There are some 

    subtle differences however.&nbsp; Most of these are documented in the 

    accompanying VFS project file &quot;VFSEg&quot;, in the Samples folder of NS Basic/Palm 3.0.1 or later.&nbsp; This is how you get started.</font><p>

    <font face="Arial">1.&nbsp; Open the VFSEg project file.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">2.&nbsp; If your Palm emulator does not automatically start, start it. 

    Make sure you are using a ROM file that supports extended memory (I will be 

    using the Palm M505 with SD card support).</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">3.&nbsp; Install the HostFS_Emulator (in the Tools folder).</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">4.&nbsp; Create a directory on your hard drive where your&nbsp; 

    &quot;simulated&quot; you SD card/Memory stick will be.&nbsp; My example will assume 

    you are using <a href="file:///C:/SDCard">C:\SDCard</a></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">5.&nbsp; Under the directory &quot;C:\SDCard&quot; create a &quot;PALM&quot; subdirectory, and 

    a &quot;launcher&quot; sub subdirectory inside the PALM directory.&nbsp; You should 

    finish with a <a href="file:///C:/SDCard/PALM/launcher">

    C:\SDCard\PALM\launcher</a> structure.&nbsp; Any files you would like to 

    show up on the memory card should be placed in this directory.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">4.&nbsp; Right click on the Emulator and go to settings, and then HostFS...</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">5..Select Slot #1, click on browse to &quot;<a href="file:///C:/SDCard">C:\SDCard</a>&quot;. 

    Click OK</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">6.&nbsp; Check off Mount and then OK.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">7.&nbsp; Right click the emulator and do a soft reset.&nbsp; Your SD card 

    should show up in the App launcher as &quot;POSESlot1&quot; or something similar.&nbsp; 

    Your emulator is now ready to run the VFSEg project.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">In NSBasic, click on F5 to run.&nbsp; You may have to change the location 

    of the shared libraries etc.&nbsp; I'll leave that challenge up to you.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">This project demonstrates a number of functions within the VFSLib.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">Copy to Palm - with and without a dialog<br>

    Copy to Card<br>

    Version<br>

    VFSInit<br>

    Delete<br>

    Position<br>

    ReadString and more...</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">and more importantly, how to read the number of records and how to read 

    strings and integers from a PDB file on the memory stick.&nbsp; All 

    documentation/code is in the file and should be self explanatory.&nbsp; If 

    you have any questions or comments, please post them on the NSBasic board 

    for someone to take a look at.</font></p>
