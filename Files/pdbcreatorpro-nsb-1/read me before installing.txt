Installing PDB Creator Pro NSB:

PDB Creator Pro NSB is a version of PDB Creator Pro designed to be distributed by NSBasic for use by NSBasic/Palm users.  When running the NSBasic/Palm IDE, PDB Creator Pro NSB will be placed automatically in the "Tools" menu, if you install it in the NSBasic/Tools folder.  The default installation location for this folder (and PDB Creator Pro NSB) is:

c:\nsbasic\tools

If your NSBasic/Palm installation places the Tools folder in a different location, be sure to install PDB Creator Pro NSB in that directory.
