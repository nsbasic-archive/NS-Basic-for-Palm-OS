Please note there are two Agreements here. One is for
NS BASIC Corporation, the other for PalmSource. By accepting
this, you are agreeing to both Agreements.

LICENSE AGREEMENT

PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SOFTWARE. 
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE 
TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF 
THIS LICENSE, PROMPTLY RETURN THE PRODUCT TO THE PLACE WHERE 
YOU OBTAINED IT AND YOUR MONEY WILL BE REFUNDED. 

1. License. The application, demonstration, system, and other 
software accompanying this License, whether on disk, in read 
only memory, or on any other media (the "Software"), the 
related documentation and fonts are licensed to you by NS 
BASIC Corporation ("NSBC"). You own the media on which the 
Software and fonts are recorded but NSBC and or NSBC's 
Licenser(s) and suppliers retain title to the Software, 
related documentation and fonts and are protected by United 
States copyright laws, by laws of other nations and 
international treaties. This License allows you to use the 
Software and fonts on a single Windows Product (which, for 
purposes of this License, shall mean a product bearing 
Microsoft's Windows logo), and make one copy of the Software 
and fonts in machine-readable form for backup purposes only. 
You must reproduce on such copy the NSBC copyright notice and 
any other proprietary legends that were on the original copy 
of the Software and fonts. You may also transfer all your 
license rights in the Software and fonts, the backup copy of 
the Software and fonts, the related documentation and a copy 
of this License to another party, provided the other party 
reads and agrees to accept the terms and conditions of this 
License.  

2. Restrictions. The Software contains copyrighted material, 
trade secrets and other proprietary material and in order to 
protect them you may not decompile, reverse engineer, 
disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-
perceivable form. You may not modify, network, rent, lease, 
load, distribute or create derivative works based upon the 
Software in whole or in part. You may not electronically 
transmit the Software from one device to another or over a 
network.  

3. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. 
You may terminate this License at any time by destroying the 
Software and related documentation and fonts. This License 
will terminate immediately without notice from NSBC if you 
fail to comply with any provision of this License. Upon 
termination you must destroy the Software, related 
documentation and fonts.  

4. Export Law Assurances. You agree and certify that neither 
the Software nor any other technical data received from NSBC, 
nor the direct product thereof, will be exported outside the 
United States except as authorized and as permitted by the 
laws and regulations of the United States. If the Software 
has been rightfully obtained by you outside of the United 
States, you agree that you will not reexport the Software 
nor any other technical data received from NSBC, nor the 
direct product thereof, except as permitted by the laws and 
regulations of the United States and the laws and regulations 
of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Software.  

5. Government End Users. If you are acquiring the Software 
and fonts on behalf of any unit or agency of the United 
States Government, the following provisions apply. The 
Government agrees: (i) if the Software and fonts are 
supplied to the Department of Defense (DoD), the Software 
and fonts are classified as "Commercial Computer Software" 
and the Government is acquiring only "restricted rights" in 
the Software, its documentation and fonts as that term is 
defined in Clause 252.227-7013(c)(1) of the DFARS; and (ii) 
if the Software and fonts are supplied to any unit or agency 
of the United States Government other than DoD, the 
Governments' rights in the Software, its documentation and 
fonts will be as defined in Clause 52.227-19(c)(2) of the 
FAR or, in the case of NASA, in Clause 18-52.227-86(d) of the 
NASA supplement to the FAR.  

6. NS BASIC will replace at no charge defective disks or 
manuals within 90 days of the date of purchase. NS BASIC 
warranties that the programs will perform generally in 
compliance with the included documentation. NS BASIC does not 
warrant that the programs and manuals are free from all bugs, 
errors or omissions. 

7. Disclaimer of Warranty on Software. You expressly 
acknowledge and agree that use of the Software and fonts is 
at your sole risk. The Software, related documentation and 
fonts are provided "AS IS" and without warranty of any kind 
and NSBC and NSBC's Licenser(s) (for the purposes of 
provisions 7 and 8, NSBC and NSBC's Licenser(s) shall be 
collectively referred to as "NSBC") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL 
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NSBC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS 
CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT 
THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-
FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE AND THE FONTS WILL BE 
CORRECTED. FURTHERMORE, NSBC DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY 
REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF 
THE SOFTWARE AND FONTS OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN TERMS OF 
THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. NO 
ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY NSBC OR A NSBC 
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY 
WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU (AND NOT NSBC OR AN NSBC AUTHORIZED 
REPRESENTATIVE) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE 
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. This limited warranty gives 
you specific rights. You may have others, which vary from 
state to state. LICENSOR'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE 
REMEDY SHALL BE, AT LICENSOR'S CHOICE, EITHER (A) RETURN OF 
THE PRICE PAID OR (B) REPLACEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE THAT DOES 
NOT MEET LICENSOR'S LIMITED WARRANTY AND WHICH IS RETURNED 
TO LICENSOR WITH A COPY OF YOUR RECEIPT. Any replacement 
Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original 
warranty period or 30 days, whichever is longer. This Limited 
Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from 
modification, accident, abuse, or misapplication.

8. Limitation of Liability. Because software is inherently 
complex and may not be free from errors, you are advised to 
verify the work produced by the Program. UNDER NO 
CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL NSBC BE LIABLE FOR 
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT 
FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR RELATED 
DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF NSBC OR A NSBC AUTHORIZED 
REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR 
EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY 
TO YOU. In no event shall NSBC's total liability to you for 
all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, 
tort (including negligence) or otherwise) exceed the amount 
paid by you for the Software and fonts. 

9. Allocation of Risk: You acknowledge and agree that this 
Agreement allocates risk between you and NSBC as authorized 
by the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable law and 
that the pricing of NSBC's products reflects this allocation 
of risk and the limitations of liability contained in this 
Agreement. If any remedy hereunder is determined to have 
failed of its essential purpose, all limitations of liability 
and exclusions of damages as set forth in this Agreement will 
remain in effect.

10. Support. NSBC may, at its option, provide support services 
at its standard fees for such services. Such support services 
will be governed by the limitations of liability under this 
Agreement.

11. Additional Restrictions: Any upgrade or enhancement of the 
program subsequently supplied by NSBC may only be used upon 
the destruction of the prior version, and shall be governed 
by the terms of this Agreement.

12. Controlling Law and Severability. This License shall be 
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
United States and the State of Delaware, as applied to 
agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within 
Delaware between Delaware residents. If for any reason a 
court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this 
License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that 
provision of the License shall be enforced to the maximum 
extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, 
and the remainder of this License shall continue in full force 
and effect.  

13. Complete Agreement. This License constitutes the entire 
agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the 
Software, related documentation and fonts, and supersedes all 
prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written 
or oral, regarding such subject matter. No amendment to or 
modification of this License will be binding unless in 
writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of 
NSBC.

(c) Injunctive Relief - You acknowledge and agree that the copying,
disclosure or use of the Software or any information, materials or
services provided hereunder in a manner inconsistent with any provision
of this Agreement shall cause irreparable injury to PalmSource for which

under this Agreement as independent contractors. This Agreement does
not, and is not intended to, create any employment, agency,
distributorship, franchise, joint venture, legal partnership or other
similar legal relationship between PalmSource and You.  Neither party
will have any right or authority to act on behalf of, or to bind, the
other party and neither party will represent to any third party that it
has such right or authority.

(e) Non-Exclusivity; Freedom of Action – This Agreement is not exclusive
in any respect. Each party may enter into similar agreements with other
parties. You acknowledge that PalmSource intends to enter into similar
agreements with other companies who may compete directly or indirectly

agreement to the contrary, PalmSource will be free to use any
information provided by You to PalmSource for any purpose, subject to
any applicable patents or copyrights.

(g) No Assignment – You may not assign or otherwise transfer this
Agreement or the rights or obligations hereunder (either in whole or in
part, whether voluntarily, by way of merger, by operation of law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of PalmSource, which
consent may be withheld in PalmSource’s sole discretion, and any
attempted transfer or assignment is null and void and shall be deemed a
material breach of this Agreement.

(h) Entire Agreement; Amendment - This Agreement represents the
complete, final and exclusive agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended in whole or in part except
by written amendment entered into by authorized representatives of the
parties. 

(i) Waiver - A waiver of any default hereunder or of any of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a
continuing waiver or a waiver of any other default or of any other term
or condition, but shall apply solely to the instance to which such
waiver is directed. 

(j) Governing Law and Language - This Agreement
shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
conflict-of-law provisions and the laws of the United States. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed. The parties hereto
confirm that they have requested that this Agreement and all related
documents be drafted in English. 

(k) Jurisdiction - You hereby submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of, and waive any venue objections against,
the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara and/or the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California with respect to
any dispute arising out of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above,
either PalmSource or You may obtain preliminary or permanent injunctive
relief from any court of competent jurisdiction worldwide. 

(l) Export -
You acknowledge that the export or re-export of any Software is subject
to the Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774.  You
shall comply strictly with all such United States export controls and
shall not export, re-export, transfer or divert any of the Software or
any direct product thereof, to any destination, end-use or end-user that
is prohibited or restricted under such United States export control laws
and regulations, except as specifically authorized by the United States
Department of Commerce. 

(m) Severability - If a competent court holds
any provision of this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable in
whole or in part under applicable law such provision or such portion
thereof shall be ineffective as to the jurisdiction in which such court
is located to the extent of its illegality, invalidity or
unenforceability and shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to
conform to applicable law so as to give the maximum effect to the intent
of the parties.  The illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of such
provision in that jurisdiction shall not in any way affect the legality,
validity or enforceability of such provision or of any other provisions
of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.
