# NS-Basic-for-Palm-OS

It's a miracle this even exists.

The experience of resurrecting this software is similar to the odyssey of Mason Mark, [detailed here](https://github.com/masonmark/Dash-Board-for-Newton-OS).

Feel free to look at the code, try to run it and have fun.

Go ahead and open issues - I won't be fixing any of them. 
Seriously, it's 10 years since I've looked at the source.

The desktop side of the app was developed using [Visual BASIC 6](https://visual-basic-6.com/).

The Palm OS runtime was developed using [MetroWerks CodeWarrior](https://palmdb.net/app/codewarrior).

NS BASIC for Palm was released in 2000 and was developed until 2009.

The [website](https://www.nsbasic.com/palm/) is still around.

The code to unzip the installer archive is `fatchoy`. For a serial number, use `D20-315-50o`.
