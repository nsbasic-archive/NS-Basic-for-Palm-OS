This *						is a 'libr' resource in the "Sample Library" resource database. *						This resource contains the Library API entry points.  *						 *						Beginning with PilotOS v2.0, to install the library, the application *						or another library calls SysLibLoad().  The library's "open" and "close" *						functions should be called to initialize and de-initialize the library. *						SysLibRemove() is called to uninstall the library. *					 *						(On PilotOS v1.x, the application *						needs to open the libarary database, lock down this library code resource, *						close the database without unlocking the resource, and pass its pointer to *						SysLibInstall().  SysLibInstall() will jump to this resource to have it *						install it's dispatch table into the library entry. The library's "open" *						and "close" functions should be called to initialize and de-initialize the *						library.  When the application is done with the library, it needs to call *						SysLibRemove, and then unlock the library code resource.  On v1.x, *						SysLibRemove calls the library's "close" function; for this reason, the *						library's close function should be able to deal with this "extra" close call.) * *  PARAMETERS:    *					refNum - refNum of library *					entryP - pointer to entry in library table. * *  RETURNS:   	0 if no error    * *  CALLED BY:    SysLibInstall() * *  CREATED:      5/19/97 * *  BY:           vmk * ***********************************************************************/Err NSBTreoLibInstall(UInt16 refNum, SysLibTblEntryPtr entryP){	// Install pointer to our dispatch table	entryP->dispatchTblP = (MemPtr*)NSBTreoLibDispatchTable();		// Initialize globals pointer to zero (we will set up our library	// globals in the library "open" call).	entryP->globalsP = 0;	return 0;	}/************************************************************ * *  FUNCTION: Dispatch Table for Sample Library * *  DESCRIPTION: This table gets installed into the dispatchTblP *		field of the library entry in the library table.
