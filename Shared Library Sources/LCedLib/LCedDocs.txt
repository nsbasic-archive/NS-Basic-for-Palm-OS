LCed is an easy to use TCP/IP shared library. It allows NS Basic programs to do simple reads and writes over a Tcp/Ip connection. It has been tested it on POSE with several ROMs and on a Visor with the Xircom wireless Ethernet module. It even restores the TCP/IP connection after sleep (when the connection is not closed from the server side). 

Here are the calling conventions:

fd = TcpOpen(hostname, port, timeout)
-------------------------------------
Hostname = string filled with dotted IP or hostname
port     = integer for IP Port number
timeout  = integer for timeout in mS (use 5000)
fd       = integer; the reference or error code if negative

Example:
fd = TcpOpen("www.nsbasic.com", 80, 5000)
If fd < 0 Then
   msgbox "open error " + str(-fd) ' Palm error code
end if


TcpClose(fd)  ' closes the current connection fd
------------------------------------------------
fd       = integer. Value set in TcpOpen. 



data = TcpRead(fd, count, matchset, timeout)
--------------------------------------------- 
data 	 = String. the returned data. 
           Will be "" if timeout or connection closed.
fd       = integer. Value set in TcpOpen. 
count	 = integer. maximum number of characters to return
matchSet = string, up to 2 characters. TcpRead will return 
	   when one of these characters are encountered.
timeout  = timeout in milliseconds.
           This does not seem to be handled consistantly by the 
           Palm OS.

Example:
'return when 100 chars are received, 
' until a # or > was found in the stream, 
' or 2.5 seconds have passed
' or connection was closed 
timeout = 2500
toread = 100
data = TcpRead(fd, toread, "#>", timeout) 



written = TcpWrite(fd, data)
----------------------------  
fd       = integer. Value set in TcpOpen. 
data     = string, 
written  = integer

Returns the number of bytes of data written (if negative it's an error)



TcpFlush(fd)  ; flushes the input buffer
----------------------------  
fd       = integer. Value set in TcpOpen.
